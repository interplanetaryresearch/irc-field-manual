# Field Manual

IRC is a non-commercial technology cooperative with interests in near space observation, lunar and extraterrestrial agriculture, colonization, and mining.

This Field Manual describes Interplanetary Research Cooperatives mission/vision, standing operating procedures, and governance.

## Mission
We love our Earth and the Space that surrounds it. We want to learn more through direct observation and experimentation. We're here to inspire and equip others to observe and experiment making space accessible to all humans.

We exist because of the many hobbyists, researchers, and scientists who inspired us as children and continue to inspire us as adults.
