## NASA Science "Citizen Scientists to Measure Local Air Quality Using Low-Cost Sensors"

As part of a NASA-funded project, we are looking for interested citizen scientists to use low-cost air quality sensors to measure particle concentrations in their neighborhood.  The data will be used to help understand differences between estimates using satellite data and that measured using ground monitors.  Citizen Scientists will have opportunity to interact with the project team and other citizens to explore questions of their own.

### Questions

#### What is your field of work or study?
Exploring Connected Technology for Environmental and Near Space Observation

#### Where do you plan to install the low-cost sensor? Please provide the latitude and longitude of the potential location. If not available, please provide the address. *
Latitude and longitude of a location can be determined from online location services. For example, you can search for the address in Google Maps and click on the location pin to see the coordinates of that address.
40.477430, -79.810577

#### Does that location have access to 24/7 electricity, barring unexpected outages? *
Yes

#### Does the location have access to 24/7 wireless internet access, barring unexpected outages *
Yes

#### On average, how much time can you spend on this project per week? *
5-10 hours per week

#### Are you interested in posting data or sharing your work on social media with fellow citizen scientists, writing your own blogs, etc? If so, please explain your areas of interest.
I am very interested. I have been experimenting with low-cost prototyping sensor and I'm beginning to investigate HCHO and VOC sensors. I am interested in the public availability of data through APIs and UIs that equip and empower citizens to access and analyze data about the local environments that impact their health. I have worked with over a dozen organizations to help them visualize their water quality data and environmental restoration project data.
Explain briefly your prior experience, if any, with sensors, satellite data and analysis of air quality data *
I am a software engineer and Chief Product Officer of a data company called Viable. In my role at Viable I am in charge of citizen-based water quality data visualization and systems development. At Viable and at home I experiment with prototyping hardware solutions with electronic components and prototyping boards to collect data about the environment around me.

#### Describe briefly your interest in this project, what you would like to gain from participating in this project, and how you hope to use this data. *
I would like to gain the ability to understand satellite imagery as it pertains to environmental data and better understand how sensors work electronically to record data. The data collected, with permission, I would like to post in a real-time format via an API to the internet. I would prefer access to the data to be freely available, however, I understand the hosting costs and would like to figure out a way to offset those costs by making the data APIs available under a subscription model that would continue to support my own field of study "Exploring Connected Technology for Environmental and Near Space Observation".
